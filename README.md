90-100: A
80-89: B
70-79: C
60-69: D
0-59: F
Invalid score: If the input is not within the 0-100 range.
Output:

The script displays the calculated letter grade.
Code Explanation:

User Input:
The input function prompts the user to enter a score.
Switch-Case:
The switch true syntax allows for multiple conditions to be checked.
Each case statement checks a specific range of scores.
The otherwise case handles invalid scores.
